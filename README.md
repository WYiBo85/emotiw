# EmotiW: Video Sentiment Analysis in the Wild

## Introduction
Despite cultural diversity, emotions are universal. We will undertake the EmotiW challenge, doing group-level sentiment recognition on videos from across the globe. Given short clips, the goal is to predict whether the video sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative. This problem is interesting because audio-visual sentiment analysis has implications in psychology and mental health.
